# Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified.
# Tuples use Parenthesis instead of Brackets

numbers = (1, 2, 3)

# cannot use list methods like numbers.append() since numbers is a tuple.
# methods that return information about the tuple are still allowed
# Example:
#print(numbers[0])

# Trying to change tuples will return a TypeError
