# 2:15:43

coordinates = (1, 2, 3)

# coordinates[0] * coordinates[1] * cooredinates[2]
# Code is messy, heres anotherway to do it

# 
#x = coordinates[0]
#y = coordinates[1]
#z = coordinates[2]

# Unpacking, the code below does the same thing as the 3 lines of code above.
x, y, z = coordinates
# The tuple is being unpacked into three variables

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# This concept works with lists as well
